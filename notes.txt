- first we want to import the csv file
- there should be a way to read from the csv file
- two options: 
	- parse the whole thing first ** go with this
	- or do the parsing and the testing in one loop
- so parse the whole thing, probably want a data structure to store the q/a pairs
	- can make a struct to store question and answer as (strings?)
	- or can have a map from question to answer ** probably easier, map[string]string
- then need to show the user the questions on the command line and get input
	- so need to output to stdout and wait for user input
	- then parse the input and compare with the answer
- for part 2, the basic idea is:
	 - start a timer in the background (go time)
	 - the timer function should sleep for the limit
	 - then send a message on a channel when it wakes up
	 - the main thread stops when it receives on that channel
- background func needs to send a value each time the user
	sends something. then the switch blocks on two channels, 
	the timer one and the questions one
